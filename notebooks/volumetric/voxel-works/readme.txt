I use a dataset(modelnet10) which is in Download/datasets/... folder.
As I'm using github tracking in here, I don't want to add that big
folder into this project. If you are running this code in/from a
place other than the local machine, please put the modelnet10 in 
~/Downloads/datasets/data_/ModelNet10/ or change this folder's file
content based on that location you desire.
